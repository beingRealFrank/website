I’ve struggled a lot with my mental health, but the last year has been different. I finally started feeling like myself again. I wasn’t broken or sick, but I’m a better person than I was.  

I’m sharing this because a few things really helped me. They won’t land for everyone, but they were huge for me and if they help someone else, I’ll be happy.

What actually moved the needle was realizing two things worked together: getting real help and really doing my own work. Trying to white-knuckle it alone never worked, and waiting for a doctor to magically fix everything didn’t either. The progress happened when I treated it like a partnership.

A men’s group I joined gave me a reading list, and a few books hit me harder than I expected:  

* Taking Responsibility by Nathaniel Branden  
* Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink  
* No More Mr. Nice Guy by Robert Glover

They shifted me from obsessing about everything outside my control to actually looking inward. I always thought I lived that way, but I really wasn’t.

The biggest turning point was going back to my ADHD diagnosis. Not obsessing about it. Just admitting that I needed structure, needed help, and needed to stop pretending I could figure it out later. 

Once I actually followed through, things started to click. Meds finally make sense. My focus is better. My impulses are calmer, and all of it has lifted my mood.

If there is any takeaway here, it is simply this:

I got better when I stopped outsourcing everything to other people AND stopped pretending I didn’t need them.
