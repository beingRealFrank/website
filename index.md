Hi there. Welcome to my site, and thanks for stopping by. My name is Frank. 

I'm a tech guy, but not a bro. I like to write, keep moving, and play games. 

I've organized my posts into two broad categories: [blather](/blather/), and [useful](/useful/).

I am obsessed with Pokémon Go. 

Peruse my [Pokémon Go Resources page](/pokemon-go/), feel free to ask me questions.
